# Project Name
IOT DISPLAY

## Summary

I am going to build an IOT display device that can display content from internet sources to an display device that can fetch live data and update time to time. For example, to make it more simple; It can display Youtube Subscriber Counts live from Youtube Channel.
Or, Fetching an Stocks Market Prices from internet.
## Plan

First of all, I will use an API to fetch the JSON data from the internet. For instance, I can use GoogleAPI to grab JSON data for Youtube Subscriber Counts. Then parse that data using ESP32 and display on mounted display device. 

## Budget

I do have access to microcontroller boards, Raspberry Pi and other components to build my project though I would need following components to complete and experiement more with the project I am going to build.

| Product         | Supplier/Link                         | Cost   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------ |
| CicuitPython Internet Display| [Display With Circuit Python](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4116) | $54.95  |
| Monochrome E-Ink Display | [E-Ink Display for Displaying through PI] (https://www.adafruit.com/product/4687) | $9.95 |
| Monochrome E-Ink Display | [E-Ink Display for Displaying through PI] (https://www.adafruit.com/product/4687) | $9.95 |
| Pimoroni Inky pHAT Display } [E-Ink Display] (https://www.adafruit.com/product/3934) |24.95|
| Total           |                                       | $99.8 |

I don't have that much knowledge for shipping but I heard from parents that shipping cost might be little more so I tried to stay low on the budget by using components that I already have in my home to cover up the additional charges.
